1.This folder will separate the simulation(500 sets @ 145GHz) into five groups, and run the reconstruction simultaneously ('process1' - 'process5').

2.After we finish the calculation of reconstructed phi alm, we move them to 'process_added', where we calculate the mean-field and store the final reconstructed phi alm.

3.Optional estimate of Cl will be performed in 'process_Cl'.

Details can be find in each sub-folders.
