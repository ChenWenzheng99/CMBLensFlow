This is a **general example** demonstrating how to **validate simulation data** and perform **MCMC analyses** to obtain **cosmological parameter constraints**.

## Key Files

- **`cal_cov_mat.ipynb`**  
  Computes the **mean vectors** and **covariance matrices** of the auto- and cross-power spectra of the **lensing template (LT)** and the **observed B-modes**.  
  The resulting **data vector** and **covariance matrix** are generated for subsequent MCMC analyses.

- **`run_mcmc.ipynb`**  
  Loads the data vector and its covariance matrix, and performs the following steps:
  - Computes the **χ² value** of the data to check consistency with the number of degrees of freedom  
  - Explores different **covariance conditioning schemes**  
  - Compares three likelihood models:
    - Gaussian likelihood  
    - Hamimeche–Lewis (HL) likelihood  
    - Sellentin–Heavens (SH) likelihood  
  - Runs **MCMC sampling** to derive **parameter constraints**

This example provides a complete workflow from **simulation validation** to **likelihood evaluation** and **parameter inference**.
